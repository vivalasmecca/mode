# MODE — Page Builder Agent
## Claude Code Kickoff Document
**Project:** MODE / Hyve Digital (prior works — IP protected)**
**Build context:** Nights + weekends. Independent of LZ.

## What this project is

MODE is an intent-aware design system built as a semantic layer on top of Radix UI components, targeted at SaaS businesses. The page builder agent is the first working surface — it takes a brief, proposes an information architecture, then selects and populates components to build a semantic HTML page.

The agent exists. The UI dashboard is built and working. The current focus is on multi-variant generation and preview evaluation.

## Architecture: the three tiers

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  SEMANTIC INTENT LAYER                  │
│  Why this pattern exists.               │
│  What job it's doing.                   │
│  Which archetype it serves.             │
│  Funnel stage, context mode, tone.      │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  MODULE LAYER                           │
│  Named, trackable compositions.         │
│  Analytics and governance hooks here.   │
│  SEO/PMM operate at this layer.         │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  MICRO-BLOCK LAYER                      │
│  Reusable primitives.                   │
│  Headline/subhead lockups, card grids,  │
│  stat blocks, CTAs, etc.                │
│  Modules are built from these.          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key principle:** Micro-block granularity only works if the semantic layer maintains accountability. Without it, composition is invisible to analytics and deprecation becomes impossible. Both tiers are necessary.

## The four resolution dimensions

Every component resolves its UI behavior across these dimensions:

| Dimension | Scope | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| **Archetype** | User identity (stable) | Mover, Validator, Explorer |
| **Funnel Stage** | Page-level declaration | Awareness, consideration, decision, conversion |
| **Intent State** | Session-level register | Emotional mode of the current interaction |
| **Context Mode** | Environmental frame | Campaign, organic, retargeting, etc. |

Page-level sets the declaration (funnel stage + context mode + tone). This cascades down. Component-level overrides are available but exceptional.

### The three archetypes

- **Mover** — acts fast, low friction, high confidence. Minimal copy, strong CTA, no noise.
- **Validator** — needs reassurance, considered, trust-seeking. Social proof, specificity, space to think.
- **Explorer** — browsing, discovery mode, not ready to commit. Content-rich, low pressure, navigational.

**Important:** Archetype is a property of the *visitor*, not the palette. It is always declared and fixed for a given build — it drives behavioral tokens (copy density, evidence level, CTA rules) and IA shape. Archetype and palette driver are separate concepts.

*These archetypes predate this project and are core IP.*

## Palette drivers — how design tokens are remapped

The palette driver determines which runtime signal remaps the visual design tokens (dark / light / neutral) per section. Three are built, configured in `tokens/mode-tokens.json`:

| Preset | Palette driver | Variant dimension | Variants generated |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|--------------------|
| `funnel-driven` | funnel stage | `funnel_stage` | awareness, consideration, decision, conversion |
| `feature-emphasis` | editorial intent | `funnel_stage` | awareness, consideration, decision, conversion |
| `archetype-driven` | archetype | `archetype` | Mover, Validator, Explorer |

**`funnel-driven` is the most common and should be the default.** Archetype-driven is valid and important for the connection between visitor identity and visual expression, but used less frequently.

The active preset is set in `tokens/mode-tokens.json` → `"active_preset"` and determines the **default** selection in the Build form. The Build form lets the user switch presets per build — the selected preset is passed through the full pipeline without requiring a file edit or server restart. (`token-resolver.js` still caches `mode-tokens.json` at module load, but now accepts an optional preset override at call time so all presets can be used from a single server session.)

When archetype-driven is active: archetype drives *both* behavioral tokens (always) *and* the palette (via the active preset). This is the semantic connection between visitor identity and visual language.

## The page builder agent — what exists

The agent pipeline:

1. `ia-planner.js` — takes brief + manifest, proposes section-by-section IA (Claude Opus)
2. `component-selector.js` — selects specific component + variant for each IA slot (Claude Haiku)
3. `token-resolver.js` — resolves behavioral tokens and palette per component (no LLM, reads mode-tokens.json)
4. `content-generator.js` — populates all slots with real copy (Claude Sonnet)

Output is written to `output/page-{timestamp}-{variant}.json`. Multi-variant builds produce one file per variant.

---

## UI dashboard — current state (as of June 2026)

The dashboard is a Next.js 16 app in `ui/`. Start it with `npm run dev` from `ui/`.

```
http://localhost:3000/dashboard       ← Overview (latest output)
http://localhost:3000/dashboard/build ← Build form (multi-variant generation)
http://localhost:3000/preview         ← Latest output rendered
http://localhost:3000/preview?file=page-{ts}-{variant}.json ← Specific variant
```

### Dashboard tabs

- **Overview** — shows preset, brief, behavioral tokens, token resolution table, and IA rationale for the latest output file
- **Concepts** — static reference documentation for all brief fields and system concepts
- **Build** — the main UI for generating pages (see below)
- **Run** — (exists, purpose TBD)

### Build tab flow

1. Reads all presets from `/api/config` on mount; pre-selects the active preset from `mode-tokens.json`
2. **Palette Approach selector** — radio cards for each preset (name, description, palette driver, variants list). Switching preset updates the form below.
3. Brief fields: audience, goal, context_mode + the non-variant dimension (archetype or funnel stage, depending on selected preset)
4. Submits → selected preset + brief sent to `/api/generate/ia` → N IA proposals in parallel
5. IA review with tabs — one tab per variant, shows sections + rationale
6. "Approve & Generate All N" → full pipeline runs in parallel for each variant (preset passed to token resolver)
7. Output files saved, preview tabs opened automatically

### Key architecture decisions in the UI

**CJS agent modules from ESM Next.js routes:** The agent files (`mode/agent/*.js`) are CommonJS. They are installed as a local npm package (`"mode-agent": "file:../agent"` in `ui/package.json`) and listed in `serverExternalPackages` so Turbopack never tries to bundle them. Loaded at runtime via `createRequire`.

**`createRequire` anchoring:** Must be anchored to the project root, not `import.meta.url`:
```ts
const _require = createRequire(path.resolve(process.cwd(), "__route__"));
```
This ensures Node.js resolves `mode-agent/*` from `ui/node_modules/` regardless of where Turbopack places the compiled file.

**Turbopack root:** Set explicitly to `mode/ui/` in `next.config.ts` to prevent Turbopack from auto-detecting `mode/` as workspace root (which breaks Next.js module resolution). The warning about multiple lockfiles is expected and harmless once `turbopack.root` is set.

**Token resolver caching:** `token-resolver.js` caches `mode-tokens.json` at module load time (Node.js module cache). Changing the active preset requires restarting the dev server.

## Picking up mid-build

When dropping back in after time away, start here:

1. **Start the dashboard:** `cd ui && npm run dev` → http://localhost:3000/dashboard
2. **Go to Build tab** → select a palette approach → fill in a brief → approve IAs → generate all variants → review previews in new tabs.
3. **Default preset:** `tokens/mode-tokens.json` → `"active_preset"` controls which preset is pre-selected in the Build form. The form lets you switch per build without touching the file.
4. **If you get a "Cannot find module 'mode-agent'" error:** run `npm install` from `ui/` to restore the symlink.
5. **If the dashboard throws a JSON parse error on load:** delete `.next/` and restart (`rm -rf .next && npm run dev`).

---

## What's working

- Full pipeline: brief → IA → component selection → token resolution → content generation
- Multi-variant generation: one build run produces N variant files (N = 4 for funnel-driven, 3 for archetype-driven)
- IA review with tabs before committing to generation
- Preview at `/preview?file={filename}` for any specific variant
- Dashboard overview shows latest output (behavioral tokens, IA rationale, token resolution table)
- **Palette Approach selector in the Build form** — all three presets selectable per build; no file editing or server restart required

---

## What's next (as of June 2026)

- **Evaluate variant quality** — review the 3–4 generated variants in preview tabs and assess whether the IA, copy, and palette are meaningfully differentiated across variants
- **Visual mapping tool** — the open question: how does a designer configure token values per dimension? See "Unresolved" section below.
- **Runtime signal routing** — serving the right variant based on visitor signals (the end goal of the whole system)

---

## Unresolved: visual mapping tool

The hard architectural question is the handoff between discovery and build:

- **Discovery mode** — visual, tactile. Designer defines what "Validator in decision stage" *feels* like. Color temperature, type weight, spatial density. Impressionistic.
- **Build mode** — structured, token-mapped, exportable. Those impressions translated into actual token values the resolution engine consumes.

The gap: how does a designer set token values per dimension, and does the system compose them (per dimension × dimension = token value) or assign them per mode (Validator-in-decision is a single named profile)?

*Come back to this with 2–3 concrete examples before architecting further.*

## What MODE is for

Every SaaS product has the same problem: a design system that knows how to render components but not *why* to render them. MODE adds the semantic layer — components that know which user they're talking to, where that user is in the funnel, and what emotional register the moment requires. The result is a design system that makes better decisions by default, reduces the QA burden on every page, and gives non-designers a structured way to build without breaking brand.
